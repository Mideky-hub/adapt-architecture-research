## Abstract

Microservices have revolutionized software architecture by promoting modularity, scalability, interoperability and resilience. However, traditional design principles like SOLID have shown limitations in addressing the complexities of microservices architectures, more particularly in cloud-based environments. This research paper explores the application of the ADAPT (Asynchronous, Domain-distributed, Abstraction-moderated, Piloted through events, Transparent and observable) architecture principles and design patterns to develop a robust microservices architecture for cloud-based applications.

## Introduction

The history of software architecture is continous struggl against entropy and complexity. As applications grow in size and functionality, the era of monolithic architectures with the logical architecture (how the code is organized) and thge physical architecture (how the code is deployed) tightly coupled together has shown its limitations. Microservices architecture emerged as a solution to these challenges, offering a way to break down applications into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

If the SOLID principles

/// continue once results has been achieved.

## Literature Review

## Methodology

### Event-Driven Architecture and DX-based approach

### ADAPT Principles and Design Patterns

#### Asynchronous Communication

>"Services must be decoupled, communicating through events rather than direct calls to build resilient and scalable systems."

First principle of ADAPT architecture [1][2] focuses on asynchronous communication between microservices to enhance scalability and resilience. This section explores various asynchronous communication patterns such as message queues, event streaming, and publish–subscribe models.

##### Message queues, event streaming, and publish–subscribe models using Apache Kafka

Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that enables asynchronous communication between microservices. It allows services to publish and subscribe to streams of records, facilitating decoupled interactions. As there are multiple ways to manage message queues, Kafka is one of the most popular solutions for building event-driven architectures, therefore it is used as an example in this section.

</div>

A few rikes can benefit from using Kafka in microservices architecture include : 

- **Decoupling services**: Kafka allows services to communicate without direct dependencies, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.

- **Scalability**: Kafka's distributed architecture supports high throughput and can handle large volumes of data, its axis of scalability is horizontal due to its distributed nature. As data expand across multiple brokers, Kafka can efficiently manage increased loads by adding more brokers to the cluster.

- **Resilience & Fault Tolerance**: Kafka's fault-tolerant design ensures that messages are not lost, even in the event of service failures. It achieves this through data replication across multiple brokers and automatic failover mechanisms.

- **Real-time Data Processing**: Kafka enables real-time data streaming and processing, which is essential for applications requiring immediate insights and actions. 

- **Event Sourcing**: Kafka can be used to implement event sourcing patterns, where state changes are logged as a sequence of events, allowing for better traceability and recovery.


#### Domain-Distributed-Driven Design

>"The architecture must mirror the business domain, with services organized around business capabilities, not technical layers."

The second principle of ADAPT architecture [1][2] emphasizes the importance of aligning microservices with business domains. This section discusses Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts such as bounded contexts, aggregates, and domain events to structure services around business capabilities.

The ADAPT principle redefines the single responsibility principle from SOLID with a business capability having the complete ownership of its data and logic within a bounded context. This approach ensures that each microservice is responsible for a specific business function, avoinding some common pitfalls of microservices that going against the atomicity of business capabilities.

#### Abstraction Moderation

#### Piloted through Events and Configurations

#### Transparency and Observability through Contacts

### Implementation

### Case Study: E-commerce Application

To demonstrate the practical application of the ADAPT principles, this chapter details the migration of a reference legacy system to a cloud-based microservices architecture using ADAPT design patterns.

#### System Architecture

The current baseline architecture of the e-commerce application is structured as a typical legacy e-commerce application with a ***layered architecture*** with a **Controller Layer**, **Service Layer** and a **Repository Layer**. The application is *monolithic*, with all components ***tightly coupled*** together.

#### Technology Stack

The technical stack includes a relational database (*PostgreSQL*), a backend developed in *Java* with *Spring Boot* framework. The current service coupling is high, the **Order Service** has compile-time dependencies on the **Inventory Service** and the **Payment Service**. The Data is managed through a single database schema shared across all services with the **Billing Service** directly accessing the **User Service** database tables.

#### Migration Strategy

The migration strategy involves decomposing the monolithic application into microservices aligned with business capabilities, implementing asynchronous communication using Apache Kafka, and deploying the services on Amazon Web Services

### Benchmarking

The validity of the ADAPT Architecture Principles and Design Patterns is assessed using a suite of quantitative metrics derived from recent software engineering litterature. Those metrics replace vague notions of "clean code" and "clean architecture" with measurable criteria and structural attributes.

#### What to measure?

Derived from Panichella et al. (2021) [15], the structural coupling measures the senity of dependencies between microservices. Lower coupling values indicate better modularity and independence among services. It calcultaed as follows:

$$
SC(s_i) = \frac{\sum_{j \in S; j \not= i} dep(s_i, s_j)}{|S|}
$$

Where $dep(s_i, s_j)$ indicated a dependency from service $i$ to service $j$, and $|S|$ is the total number of services in the system. If $SC(s_i) = n$ , it means that service $s_i$ depends on $n$ other services.

With microservices architectures, when our services are too granular and too many, there's a nano-service anti-pattern that can appear, we can measure the Weighted Service Interface Count (WSIC) and the Service Interface Data Cohesion (SIDC).

The WSIC metric [20] measures API surface area and number of interfaces a service exposes, weighted by their complexity.

The SIDC is the metric that quantifie the cohesion of a service based on the cohesiveness of the operations exposed in its interface. It's defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
S &= \operatorname{SOp}(si_s)=\{o_1,\dots,o_n\},\quad n=|S|.\\
\text{For }1\le i<j\le n:&\\
\quad I_{\mathrm{param}}(o_i,o_j)&=
\begin{cases}
1,& \operatorname{ParamTypes}(o_i)\cap\operatorname{ParamTypes}(o_j)\neq\varnothing,\\
0,&\text{otherwise},
\end{cases}\\
\quad I_{\mathrm{ret}}(o_i,o_j)&=
\begin{cases}
1,& \operatorname{Ret}(o_i)=\operatorname{Ret}(o_j),\\
0,&\text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}\\
P &= \binom{n}{2}\quad(\text{number of unordered operation pairs}).\\
\text{Then}\qquad SIDC(s) &=
\begin{cases}
\displaystyle\frac{\sum_{1\le i<j\le n}\big(I_{\mathrm{param}}(o_i,o_j)+I_{\mathrm{ret}}(o_i,o_j)\big)}{2P}, & P>0,\\[8pt]
0, & P=0.
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

Beyond static code analysis, we also have to considers the operational metrics defined by the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) research program, which are widely accepted as key indicators of software delivery performance. Those metrics are the deployment frequency, the change failure rate, the lead time for changes and the mean time to recovery (MTTR).
